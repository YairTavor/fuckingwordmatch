# the Fucking Word Match game
The Fucking Word Match game is a game to help you remember fucking words that you have a hard time remembering.

Serve from any web-server, save a bunch of words (in browser's local storage), and play.

I wrote this game since me and my wife are learning German and there are words that we just can not fucking remember no
matter how many fucking times we wrote them in our notebook.
